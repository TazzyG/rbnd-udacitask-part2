# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
terminal-table: Made a nice table with proper headings, I also added the type of list as a column
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1... Change Priority of tasks
  b) Feature 2... Clear a task list
  c) Error ... if Event start exceeded finish

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project? Approximately 20 - 30 hours give or take. I broke the basic list several times, tried different approaches and tested lots. I am still not fast at figuring things out so each feature is lots of break and learn. It will come with time, I imagine.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered? Adding a column with types of list. I had to play different classes. Same with change_priority - had to remind myself of calling classes within other classes. 
I think I loved the libraries. I had know about gems but not libraries. Also I learned that going crazy with gems can break your code. So, I kept it simple, one gem at a time. 
I learned that the order of libraries is important. Broke my dates by having Date library not on top.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why? .. hmm. maybe push out an event by days/or weeks and have it move the start and end date.
4. Where do you still have room to grow? I still need to get more confortable with refactoring. These tests helped lots but I did find myself breaking things and going back to where I started. I do love modules though. I can see using this alot in my projects.
I found myself breaking things with some of the gems. For example, applying colorize for something was not always fun.

I find if I don't keep going for 2 hours a day (say get interupted with other projects). I have to relearn. It helps to take good notes. 


GIT is my pal. 
So is my console :)
